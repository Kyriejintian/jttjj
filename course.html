          <h2>HTML course</h2>  
          <p>HTML is one of the cornerstones of building the Internet world,
             which makes the creation and display of web content richer and more interactive 
             is a markup language used to create web pages and other internet applications. 
             It is not a programming language, but consists of a series of tags through 
             which the format of documents on the network can be unified, so that the scattered
              Internet resources can be connected into a logical whole</p>

          <h2>JAVA course</h2>  
          <p>Java has a wide range of applications in a variety of fields, such as writing
            desktop applications, web applications, distributed systems, and embedded system 
            applications. Whether it's a large enterprise or a startup, whether it's in the field 
            of mobile app development or cloud computing, Java is one of the preferred development 
            languages. Java is also widely used in e-commerce and web development. In addition, Java
             has important applications in the financial services industry, and its rich library and 
             tool support, as well as strong security mechanisms, make Java advantageous for developing 
             applications that involve large amounts of user data and transactions.</p>

          <h2>Python course</h2>  
          <p>Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented scripting language. 
            Its design philosophy emphasizes the readability of code and allows developers
             to express ideas in a small amount of code, while supporting a variety of programming
              paradigms, including process-oriented, object-oriented, and functional programming. 
              Python also has a large number of third-party libraries and frameworks, such as Pandas
               (which provides data structures and data analysis tools), Matplotlib (a graph library), 
               Scikit-learn (a machine learning library), Django (a web framework), etc., which greatly 
               expand the capabilities and applications of Python.</p>

          <h2>C++ course</h2>  
          <p>C++ is a widely used programming language, and C++ is an object-oriented programming language
             that supports the concepts of classes and objects. This makes the code more modular and reusable, 
             and provides object-oriented features such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
             C++ is a compiled language that provides low-level access to hardware and is therefore generally
              performant. This makes C++ the first choice for developing performance-hungry applications such 
              as gaming, scientific computing, and embedded systems.</p>

          <h2>SQL course</h2>  
          <p>SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language for manipulating databases.
             It is used to create databases, delete databases, query records, modify records, 
             add fields, and more. SQL is a computer language used to store, retrieve, and modify
              data stored in relational databases. It is the standard language for relational databases, 
              and all relational database management systems (RDBMS), such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server,
               MS Access, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, etc., use SQL as their standard processing language.</p>
